This repository, named "random_name_selecte", is used for a Christmas calendar project with friends in the autom 23 group.
The purpose of this project is to create a fun and interactive way to celebrate the holiday season. Each day leading up to Christmas, a random name will be selected from the group and a surprise gift or activity will be planned for that person.
Feel free to explore the code and contribute to make this Christmas calendar even more exciting!
